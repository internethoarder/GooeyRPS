Rock Paper Scissors


A project to combine two seperate projects & demonstrate dev flow through integration of a basic feature

Idea first came from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-first-gui-application-using-python-tkinter/
after finishing this project: https://thehelloworldprogram.com/python/python-game-rock-paper-scissors/ as the GUI project mentions in number 3# for use cases of tkinter

The objective is to adapt a basic GUI for the rock paper scissors command line project. 
I will start with just the command line version that i've already completed in VIM as my "main" & use Pycharm & github to develop the "feature" of a GUI using randint & Tkinter.
