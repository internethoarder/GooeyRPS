# GooeyRPS - Rock Paper Scissors w/ a lil gui
A project to combine two seperate projects & demonstrate dev flow through integration of a basic feature as an excercise


Idea first came from a simple [geeks for geeks project on GUI applications](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-first-gui-application-using-python-tkinter/) which mentions using the guide to adapt command line python scripts with gui
that i came across after finished the [helloworldprogram's command line rock paper scissors project](https://thehelloworldprogram.com/python/python-game-rock-paper-scissors/) 

The objective is to adapt a basic GUI for the rock paper scissors command line project. 
I will start with just the command line version that i've already completed in VIM as my "main" & use Pycharm & github to develop the "feature" of a GUI using the random library CHOICE funct & tkinter & messagebox for results

### Objectives
- learn github better & get a handle on basic development flow  
- create a project demonstrating my skills/comphrension of python with a silly two player GUI game
